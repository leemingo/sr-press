# exPress
This repository presents exPress (Explainable & Expected Press), a framework for quantifying pressing situations in football by analyzing individual player positioning and movements

## installation and environment
```
git clone https://github.com/leemingo/sr-press.git
cd sr-press
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Library
- This project was developed using Python 3.9.20.
- Install the necessary libraries:
- To use the latest version of the socceraction library, you need to clone it directly from GitHub because it cannot be updated through standard installation methods.
- Since only the socceraction package is required, set socceraction/socceraction as the root directory and remove all other unnecessary files.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/statsbomb/open-data.git
git clone https://github.com/ML-KULeuven/socceraction.git
```

## How to access data
- To access the data, navigate to the [notebook](https://github.com/leemingo/sr-press/tree/geonhee/notebook).
    1. [1-load-and-convert-statsbomb-data.ipynb](https://github.com/GeonHeeJo2000/sr-press/blob/main/notebook/1-load-and-convert-statsbomb-data.ipynb): Load the StatsBomb dataset and build the training dataset. Estimated time: 8 minutes.
    2. [2-computing-and-storing-features.ipynb](https://github.com/GeonHeeJo2000/sr-press/blob/main/notebook/2-computing-and-storing-features.ipynb): Extract features and labels from the built dataset. Estimated time: 27 minutes.
- The data is stored in the [stores](https://github.com/leemingo/sr-press/tree/geonhee/stores) directory.
 * The stores directory contains the features and labels, but due to storage limitations, not all features have been processed and included here.

## exPress Module
- [databases](https://github.com/leemingo/sr-press/tree/geonhee/express/databases): Data access and SPADL conversion (implemented _fix_pressure in base.py).
- [features](https://github.com/leemingo/sr-press/blob/geonhee/express/features.py), [labels](https://github.com/leemingo/sr-press/blob/geonhee/express/labels.py): Define features and labels.
- [component](https://github.com/leemingo/sr-press/tree/geonhee/express/components): Train the exPress model.
- [simulates.py](https://github.com/leemingo/sr-press/blob/geonhee/express/simulates.py): Predict xP based on various position changes.

## Training Module
- Once the features and labels are stored in the stores directory, you can perform training using the following steps:
    1. [3-evaluating-model-performance.ipynb](https://github.com/leemingo/sr-press/blob/main/notebook/3-evaluating-model-performance.ipynb): : Analyze the results of the training performed using [train.py](https://github.com/leemingo/sr-press/blob/main/train.py)
